// We don't care about your data. So **we don't store anything**.
// We achieve **total privacy** by storing your blog post right *in the URL*.
// While this makes the URL a little bit ungainly, we think it has some serious advantages for those looking for total privacy.

    <br /><br />
    <b>Heading</b> sizes range in hashes from 1 to 6 (#, ##, ..., ######)
    <br />
    **You can use <b>bold</b> like this** 
    <br />
    *Or <b>italics</b> like this*
    <br />
    ~~And <b>strikethrough</b> like this~~
    <br /><br />
    [Here you can add a <b>link</b>](www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
    <br />
    [Or an <b>image</b>](www.google.com/some-image.jpeg)
    <br /><br />
    1. Making a <b>list</b> is easy
    <br />
    2. Use numbers for an <b>ordered list</b>
    <br />
    - or hyphens for an <b>unordered list</b>
    <br /><br />
    What to add <b>line segments</b>? Use three hyphens like this:
    <br />
    ---
    <br /><br />
    > You can add a <b>blockquote</b> like this
    <br />
    `Or even add <b>code segments</b> inside of backticks`
    <br />
